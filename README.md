## Project - Simulating Exponentials
In this project we will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. We will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that we will need to do a thousand simulations.

Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.

* Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
* Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
* Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

## Project - Analyzing ToothGrowth Data
In this project we will perform analysis on the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package and perform some hypothesis tests on the data in the context of finding the relations within the several attributes of the dataset.

* Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
* Provide a basic summary of the data.
* Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
* State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
